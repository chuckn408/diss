# diss
Debian Integrated Support System (diss) is a project with the aim to integrate all of debian's support options (IRC, Mailing Lists, Forums, BTS) and produce a client similar to reportbug with a GUI and text-mode interface for users to seek solutions to issues with Debian systems. This will require not only development of such a client, but also an IRC bot, a centralized issue tracking server system, as well as diagnostic tree templates and possibly IRC client scripts to simplify interfacing with the system.

Aim is to code these things in Python (up for debate) and package them in Debian. The project is currently in pre-alpha scouting phase looking for interested parties and ideas. Project home will be here on github and #diss on chat.freenode.net (pending ownership of channel currently)
